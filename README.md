# CPSC332_University_DatabaseSystem
Course: CPSC 332 - File Structures and Database Systems

Description: This group project includes the use of MySQL database and PHP in order to build a simple web database application for professors and students. The database made using MySQL stores information regarding the professor, the students, and the class. This database is tied to the web via HTML and PHP in order to be made accessible, visible, and interactable with the user. From there, the user can then query for his or her desired information.

Languages used: MySQL, PHP, HTML

Note: The program no longer exists within CSUF's school server since the professor clears everything made in the server after the semester ends.
