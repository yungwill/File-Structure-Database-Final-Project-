# File Structure & Database Database System

Group final project for the class CPSC 332. We were required to create a database system using SQL that could take in and store information for students and professors and a website using HTML and PHP to access and change the data which was locked behind a username and password system.

The entire system worked correctly and there were no known bugs.

Languages used: MySQL, PHP, HTML

Note: The program no longer exists within CSUF's school server since the professor clears everything made in the server after the semester ends.
